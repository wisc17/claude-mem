/**
 * Shared worker-shutdown helper used by both `install` (to clear out a
 * running worker before overwriting plugin files) and `uninstall` (to
 * release file locks before deletion).
 *
 * Posts to `/api/admin/shutdown`, then polls `/api/health` until the
 * connection is refused (= worker is gone) or the timeout elapses.
 *
 * Best-effort: if the worker is not running, the POST throws and we
 * return immediately. Callers should never depend on this throwing.
